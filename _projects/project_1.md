title: "Autonomous Robot Path Planning Learning"
excerpt: "In this project, we seek to solve the autonomous path planning of a redundant robotic arm, which is able to reach a point in the robot's workspace with multiple joint positions. Therefore there is no analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the robot. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
